# Wordle Solver ðŸŽ“

 
This script automatically solves [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) puzzles usually within 3 or 4 attempts, depending on the first word given.

The  method it uses picks a word by calculating the weighted average using the remaining letters in the string that have not been either present or correct. Doing so will guarantee that the selected word will provide the most information possible by getting as many unused letters onto the board while keeping the ones that have landed. In this way, the pool of remaining potential words becomes narrowed even further.
